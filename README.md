## How to try it?

If you are already tested the project with another demo (3d one) you will have to remove old database, or setup new database/setup new config to connect to the database. Because it can't use data from one project with another one.

You have to add all scenes in `Scenes` folder to scene in builds, then start from scene `LoginScene2D` or `LoginScene2.5D`
